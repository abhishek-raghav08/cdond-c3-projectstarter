Dear reviewer: to bring into your notice:

1. Memstash was not working so I have tried other alternatives or I have skipped them.
2. SCREENSHOT11: Showing two nodes 1 for down and one for up. It is because I have used same private key for sensing Node exporter which was used for user of Prometheus server . My script in Prometheus.yml is sensing pometheus server but prometheus is not defined a node exporter hense it is showing as down.
